## Icon types

(OG) Original

## Custom icons

Not every Netrunner game action has a published icon. Therefore, inspired by the many fanmade Netrunner tokens, NIC includes custom icons for those game actions without official icons.

## Icon sources

**MWDelaney Github**: Recreated original and [NetrunnerDB](https://netrunnerdb.com) / [RetekiDB](https://nrdb.reteki.fun) icons.

## Embedding icons

If your online resource has the capability, embedding an SVG icon provides higher quality and flexibility.

## What about NSG icons?

NIC includes Netrunner's original icons (recreated), therefore NSG will not permit their icons on this site. Source: [NSG Visual Assets Guidelines and Terms & Conditions](https://nullsignal.games/about/nsg-visual-assets) - "Please do not mix our graphic assets with any FFG assets."
